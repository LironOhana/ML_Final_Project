# ML_Final_ProjectüèÄ


We aim to develop a machine learning predictive model to estimate the likelihood of NBA players being chosen as All-Stars. The selection process for All-Star starters from both the Eastern and Western Conferences relies on a weighted distribution of votes: 50% from fans, 25% from fellow players, and 25% from members of the media. Conversely, reserve players are selected based on the combined votes of NBA coaches.

Our project will primarily focus on analyzing player data from each season spanning 1951 to 2019. While player performance does not directly determine the All-Star selections, it indirectly influences the decisions of fans, players, and the media.

## Packages Used

* XGBoost - Gradient boosting framework



## Machine Learning and Predicting NBA All-Star Players

Machine learning (ML) contributes significantly to predictive modeling. In this project, we have chosen to predict NBA All-Star players using various machine learning tools, such as clustering.

### Data Imbalance and Limitations

**Data Imbalance:**
The dataset exhibits a significant imbalance, with a considerably larger number of regular players compared to All-Star players. This imbalance may impact the model's ability to accurately predict All-Star selections.

**Prediction Methodology:**
- **Logistic Regression:** A baseline model for predicting All-Star players based on player statistics.
 
- **Clustering:** Utilizing clustering techniques to group players based on shared characteristics, enhancing predictive capabilities.
 
- **Anomaly Detection:** Identifying and handling outliers to improve overall model accuracy.

- **Evaluation:** Employing metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the model's effectiveness.

### Project Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning:** Removing irrelevant features, handling missing values, and ensuring data quality.
 
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing relationships between features, identifying outliers, and understanding data correlations.

3. **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features, like Player Efficiency Rating (PER), to enhance predictive capabilities.

4. **Model Training:** Employing logistic regression, clustering, and anomaly detection to build a robust predictive model.

5. **Evaluation:** Assessing model performance using precision, recall, and F1-score.

6. **Anomaly Removal:** Identifying and removing anomalies to improve the model's accuracy.

### Limitations

1. **Data Imbalance:** The model faces challenges due to the significant disparity in the number of regular players and All-Star players. This may lead to biased predictions
2. **Evaluation Bias:** The evaluation metrics may be affected by the data imbalance, requiring additional techniques or sampling strategies to mitigate bias.

### Conclusion

By combining various machine learning techniques, we aim to develop a predictive model capable of accurately identifying NBA All-Star players. Acknowledging data imbalances and limitations is crucial, and continuous refinement and evaluation will be employed to achieve optimal results.
